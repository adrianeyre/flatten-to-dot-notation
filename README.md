# Programming Exercise

## Brief

A module is required to flatten nested data structures into a single object with keys delimited by a full stop (.).

- Input should be a complex type, raising an exception when this isnâ€™t the case.
- Think carefully about any error handling that may be required.
- Unit tests should be produced to ensure all functionality works as expected.

You can submit your solution in a language of your choice.

We are looking to understand your approach to solving this problem as much as the actual technical solution. Add comments to your code to help us understand your thinking.

Googling syntax is allowed, googling solutions is not.

## Example Input 
```json
{
    "some": {
        "nested": "data",
        "object": {
            "with": {
                "nested": "data"
            }
        },
        "another": [
            {
              "object": "data"
            }
        ],
        "empty": []
    }
}
```
## Example Output
```json
{
    "some.nested": "data",
    "some.object.with.nested": "data",
    "some.another[0].object": "data"
}
```
